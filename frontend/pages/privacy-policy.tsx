        <p>We know that privacy policies on websites can be long (really long!), full of legal jargon, and confusing. </p>

Interactions with the Site and the Services rely on smart contracts stored on a publicly available blockchain, cryptographic tokens generated by the smart contracts, and other nascent software, applications and systems that interact with blockchain-based networks. One of the defining features of blockchain technology is that its entries are immutable, which means, as a technical matter, that they generally cannot be deleted or modified by anyone. If you are not comfortable assuming the inherently immutable and public nature of all entries on the blockchain, you should not engage with our Site to edit content or mint images.

            These additional disclosures apply only to California residents.

                The General Data Protection Regulations in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom (“GDPR”) distinguish between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as
                “controllers”) and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as “processors”). We act as a controller with respect to personal data collected as you interact with the Services.

              <p>
                The GDPR requires a “lawful basis” for processing personal data. Our lawful bases include where: (i) you have given consent to the processing for one or more specific purposes, either to us or to our service providers or partners; (ii) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you; (iii) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or (iv) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or a third party, and your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms do not override those interests. Where applicable, we will transfer your personal data to third parties subject to appropriate or suitable safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses.

Additionally, if we have collected and processed your personal data with your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
