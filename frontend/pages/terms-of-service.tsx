            The Site is provided to allow you to edit content and mint images through re:meme. These images or “memes” can be shared on Lenster once minted. We reserve the right - but are not obligated to - limit the provision of Services to any person, geographic region, or jurisdiction. We may exercise this right on a case-by-case basis in our sole discretion. We reserve the right to limit the type and number of memes that can be minted via this Site. We reserve the right to discontinue the Services at any time. Lenster is a third party website that we do not control.

          </p>
          <p>
            You connect to and interact with the Site and Services through your personal digital wallet. You are responsible for safeguarding your digital wallet. We cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to secure your wallet or damage resulting from connecting your wallet to the Site.

            <b>Entries on the blockchain are not anonymous.</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>When you use the Site and Services, you are interacting with an inherently transparent blockchain. Transparency does not mean anonymity as your public key and wallet address will be visible to everyone. If you’re not comfortable with this, you should not engage with our Site and Services.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            A widespread belief is that entries and transactions involving blockchains are anonymous. In fact, a central feature of blockchains and thus, blockchain-based transactions and entries, is that they are transparent. Your public key and your wallet address, which you need to interact with the Site, are visible to anyone. To the extent your public key or wallet address can be linked back to you, it would be possible for someone to determine your identity.
          </p>
          <p>
          All transactions and blockchain entries accessed through the Services are irreversible, final, and without refunds.

          <p>
            You understand and agree that files uploaded to the Site are hosted on the Interplanetary File System (“IPFS”), a third-party hosting service. We do not control and are not responsible for any act or omission by IPFS as it pertains to the user interface or otherwise. The use and access of any third-party products or services, including through the Services, is at your own risk. By using our Site, you consent to any content that you have uploaded being hosted on IPFS. Any content that is reported and subsequently removed from the Site will continue to remain stored as a file on IPFS.

          <p>
            <em>You accept that engaging with the Site relies on smart contracts and other experimental technology and uses networks that we do not and cannot control. Things may not go as expected. You accept that risk.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Transactions on the Site rely on smart contracts stored on a blockchain, cryptographic tokens generated by the smart contracts, and other nascent software, applications and systems that interact with blockchain-based networks. These technologies are experimental, speculative, inherently risky, and subject to change. Among other risks, bugs, malfunctions, cyberattacks, or changes to the applicable blockchain (e.g., forks) could disrupt these technologies and even result in a total loss of tokens, cryptoassets, their market value, or digital funds. You are solely responsible for the safekeeping of the private key associated with the blockchain address used to interact with the Site. We assume no liability or responsibility for any such risks. If you are not comfortable assuming these risks, you should not access or engage in transactions using blockchain-based technology.
            <br></br>
            One of the other defining features of blockchain technology is that its entries are immutable, which means, as a technical matter, they generally cannot be deleted or modified by anyone. Similarly, smart contracts, which are programs stored on a blockchain, are also immutable and cannot be deleted or modified.
          </p>
          <p>
            THUS, TRANSACTIONS RECORDED ON THE BLOCKCHAIN MUST BE TREATED AS PERMANENT AND CANNOT BE UNDONE BY US OR BY ANYONE. <b>YOU MUST BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN YOU FINALIZE ANY ENTRY OR TRANSACTION THAT WILL BE RECORDED ON THE BLOCKCHAIN.</b>

          <p>
            You bear sole responsibility for evaluating the Services before using them, and all transactions and blockchain entries accessed through the Services are irreversible, final, and without refunds. The Services may be disabled, disrupted or adversely impacted as a result of sophisticated cyber-attacks, surges in activity, computer viruses, and/or other operational or technical challenges, among other things. We disclaim any ongoing obligation to notify you of all of the potential risks of using and accessing our Services. You agree to (defined below) accept these risks and agree that you will not seek to hold any Avara UI Labs Indemnified Party responsible for any consequent losses.

          <p><em>The Site is deployed on the Polygon Networks, which we don&apos;t control.</em></p>
          <p>
            The underlying blockchain networks on which the Site is deployed, including the Polygon  Network, is open source, which means that anyone can use, utilize, and build on top of it. By using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that (i) we are not responsible for the operation of the blockchain-based software and networks underlying the Site, (ii) there exists no guarantee of the functionality, security, or availability of that software and networks, and (iii) the underlying blockchain-based networks are subject to sudden changes in operating rules, such as those commonly referred to as “forks,” which may impact parts of or your use of the Services.

            <em>Blockchains come with gas fees. We may pay for those fees on your behalf; however, we may choose to not pay for them at any time.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
          By using the Services, you understand that it is being provided to you as a giveaway good, free of charge (i.e., no consideration in the form of monetary or non-monetary compensation). However, transactions using blockchains require the payment of “gas fees,” which are fees paid on every transaction that occurs on the selected blockchain network. We may, at our sole discretion, cover the gas fees for users. We may temporarily suspend or permanently stop covering the gas fees at any time. We do not receive any fees for any transactions, the Services, or the Site.

            </em></p>
            <p>
              Content creators and owners retain their existing rights to any content uploaded, edited, or minted into an image utilizing a smart contract on the Site in connection with the Services. However, by using the Services, all users (including content creators and owners) grant limited licenses to one another to use their contributions in various ways, as discussed below.
            </p>
            <p><em>
              Users who mint images using the Services obtain a limited license to use the content.
            </em></p>
            <p>
              By using the Services to mint an image, users receive, for so long as they own the image, a limited, worldwide, non-assignable, non-sublicenseable, royalty-free license to use the image to: (i) publicly and privately display the image at any size; and (ii) to market, promote, advertise, and sell the image. This license belongs only to the then current owner of the image and automatically terminates when they no longer own the image. An image owner may expand the rights granted to image owners as part of a particular sale, in which case those rights will also be attached to the image purchased.
            </p>
            <p><em>
              Image owners may only use content in accordance with any governing Terms of Use.
            </em></p>
            <p>
              Image owners may only use, sell, trade, transfer, copy, or display the content associated with a minted image for the purpose of creating derivative works based upon the artwork (“Commercial Use”) subject to any applicable Terms of Use. Examples of Commercial Use include creating and selling copies of an image, licensing the image for commercial purposes (e.g., selling merchandise, products, or services), or otherwise commercially exploiting the image.
            </p>
            <p><em>
              Users must have all necessary rights to content before minting an image on the Site.

            <p>
              As a user, you represent and warrant that you hold all rights, licenses, authorizations, and power necessary to grant the rights held under the particular terms governing any content that you mint into an image through the Services. You agree that any such content will not violate the copyright, trademark, right of publicity (e.g., image, likeness, persona, performance, signature, voice or other indicia), or other proprietary rights of any third party. Any minted image that incorporates the works or personas of others must have been minted with the necessary permission, constitute fair use, or otherwise have valid legal rights for such use.
            </p>
            <p><em>
            You understand that you may be liable if you don&apos;t have the necessary rights to content.

            <p>
              If you do not or did not have the necessary rights to the content used to mint an image through the Services, you may be liable not only to any person whose intellectual property or other proprietary rights you violated, but also to other users, including the owner of content that has been damaged through the minting of an image and subsequent use, in which you did not hold necessary rights. This could happen, for example, if we decide to disable or otherwise remove access from the Site to an image after receiving a valid Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) takedown notification without receiving a valid counter-notification. You agree to indemnify us for any claims asserted against us arising from you not having the necessary rights required to content posted on the Site or using the Services.

              User-reported content (i.e., content that is flagged as containing Prohibited Content by a user on the Site through the “report” button”) is automatically removed from the Site while under review by the Company for a potential violation of the Terms of Service.

Once an appeal form has been submitted, the Company will use its best efforts to reply to the user, within seven (7) days after receipt of the appeal, with the Company’s determination on the appeal. If an appeal is granted, the content will be reinstated on the Site; however, if the Company determines in its sole discretion that the content violates the Terms of Service, the content will not be reinstated. A user making an appeal is limited to one appeal per image minted on the Site. Any additional appeals for the same image will not be considered.
